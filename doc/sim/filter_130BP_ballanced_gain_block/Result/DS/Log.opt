Goal functionals used for optimization:

1DC: FD2D Simulation : S-Parameters : S6,5: operate by ">" with target 25 in range: 0.1...0.15, weighted: 1.0


Optimizer detected sampling that doesn't fit to the goal definition of 0_FD2D Simulation : S-Parameters : S6,5.
Specified range is [0.1;0.15]
Sampled range is [0.1;0.149968]
The value at the range-maximum will be interpolated.
